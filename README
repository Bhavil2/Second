   Steps in code:
        Step 1: Import libraries
        Step 2: Generate synthetic data
        Step 3: Preprocessing and feature engineering for claim-level (mapping and one-hot)
        Step 4: Aggregate to patient level for clustering
        Step 5: Cluster patients
        Step 6: Assign cluster to claims
        Step 7: For each cluster, run OneClassSVM on claim-level features (the one-hot encoded data of the claim)
        Step 8: Identify outlier claims and then practitioners
        Step 9: Output the top practitioners with the most outlier claims
